## Contributions
This was not even close to being an independent project. My tutor, amazing, has helped me with some of the most frustating syntax errors. That is truly my achilles heal. I wrote the code, set up the files, I got a lot of it down myself, but I spent too much time trying to find the forest between the trees.

## Observations and Challenges
I get the concept of a handlebar and the MVC. I just have trouble figuring out why the project doesn't come together the way that it was coded. Everything should be right, but it just doesn't work with some of the elements.
